/**
 * Graceful shutdown for the relayer (#1346).
 *
 * Every orchestrator — Kubernetes rolling deploys, ECS task replacement,
 * `docker compose down` — sends SIGTERM and then waits a grace period before
 * SIGKILL. With no handler installed, Node's default action for SIGTERM is to
 * terminate immediately: the process dies mid-request, mid-scheduler-tick, and
 * mid-relay-execution.
 *
 * For this service that last one is the problem. A relay execution that is
 * killed after the transaction is signed and submitted but before the
 * confirmation is recorded leaves the ledger and our store disagreeing, with
 * nothing on either side that says which way. Draining is not hygiene here;
 * it is the difference between a deploy being invisible and a deploy creating
 * reconciliation work.
 *
 * The sequence, in order, because the order is the whole design:
 *
 *   1. **Stop taking new work.** `server.close()` stops accepting connections
 *      while letting in-flight requests finish, and the scheduler stops
 *      queueing new ticks. Anything arriving now is the load balancer's
 *      problem, which is what it is for.
 *   2. **Finish what is in flight**, bounded by a deadline. HTTP responses,
 *      the current scheduler tick, and any queue jobs drain concurrently —
 *      they are independent, and running them in series would multiply the
 *      worst case by three.
 *   3. **Exit.** Zero if everything drained, non-zero if the deadline hit
 *      first, so an orchestrator's logs distinguish a clean drain from a
 *      truncated one.
 *
 * A second signal during shutdown exits immediately: an operator pressing
 * Ctrl-C twice means "stop now", and honouring that is better than appearing
 * hung.
